            Whether you’re looking to add strength training to your gym routine or thinking of working out at home, resistance training improves muscle strength and tone and protects your joints from injury. It also is a relatively accessible option that can help you reach your weight management goals as well as maintain flexibility and balance.

            These benefits are important, especially as you get older. While increased strength and mobility are helpful to all ages, you want to be sure you are fighting muscle loss as you age. Read on to learn what resistance training is and how to get started. 
            
            What Is Resistance Training?
            Resistance training is a form of exercise intended to increase muscular strength and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of resistance. This resistance could be weights, bands, or even your own bodyweight working against gravity.
            
            When doing resistance training—which is sometimes called strength training or weight training—you can focus on specific results, such as joint stability, muscular endurance, increased muscle size, strength, and power.

            For some people, their goal with resistance training may be to build muscle mass. This process is also known as muscle hypertrophy. This goal is not just for people who want to build muscle but also for older adults who want to minimize muscle loss, also known as muscle atrophy.

Regardless of your goal, resistance training is an excellent option for building muscle mass. According to studies, the best way to build muscle is to focus on mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Persistence in this type of training regimen is essential to getting results

            Improving the strength and endurance of your muscles isn’t just for show; it also can help keep your muscles healthy and improve your quality of life. Muscle strength and endurance are important in your daily life, especially as you get older.11

            Resistance training can help your muscles remain healthy and functional. For instance, your muscles help you do small tasks, such as lifting things, opening containers, or even being active for longer hours.11
            
            According to one study, the amount of resistance training you do is directly proportional to muscular strength and endurance. If you want to improve your strength or endurance, increase the amount of resistance training you do either by expanding how long you do it or how often.
